# 3x-plus-1
Infamous math problem 3x+1
Great video explaining the history of the problem by Veritasium, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=094y1Z2wpJg

## TL;DR
Take a number, if it is even, divide it by 2, otherwise, multiply by 3, and add 1. Eventually, every number will get stuck in a loop(4, 2, 1.. 4, 2, 1)
